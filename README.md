# Code Refactor Challenge

## Description

This project involved refactoring the starter code for a webpage to optimise it with accessibility standards in mind to ensure that all users can access and use the content effectively. The source code contains semantic HTML elements, and the elements follow a logical structure. All images have accessible "alt" attributes, and the heading elements have been organized in a sequential order. These features make the webpage more accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, and provide a better user experience for everyone.
