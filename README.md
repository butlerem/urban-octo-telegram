# Horiseon Website Code Refactored For Accessibility

##Description
###The purpose of this project was to practice one of the most common tasks for junior developers; to refactor existing code to meet a certain set of standards. In this case, a marketing agency is requiring their existing site to become more accessible.
This is an important consideration for their business because it will ensure that people with disabilities can access their website using technology such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. It will also make their website better positioned in search engines, and avoid litigation that could occur if people with disabilities can't access their website. This project was a useful challenge in reworking a codebase to make it more organized and practicing consolidating CSS selectors and properties.
